      For our mobile application we are using <i>Ionic framework</i>. It is a HTML5 SDK(software development kit) built
      on top of Apache Cordova and AngularJS. It allows us to easily create hybrid mobile app and
      provides fast development time.
      It includes working with html, css and sass.
